# Network-Reliability
The objective of the project is to study experimentally how the network reliability depends on the individual link reliabilities.

To run the file in the terminal type

javac Net_Reliability.java

and then the next command
java Net_Reliability

The code will output :
1) link probability and reliability 
2) K and Reliability
